# 0x03. C - Debugging

- `0-main.c` This file must test that the function positive\_or\_negative() gives the correct output when given a case of 0.
- `1-main.c` Comment out (donâ€™t delete it!) the part of the code that is causing the output to go into an infinite loop.
- `2-largest_number.c` Fix the code in 2-largest\_number.c so that it correctly prints out the largest of three numbers, no matter the case.
- `3-print_remaining_days.c` Fix the print\_remaining\_days() function so that the output works correctly for all dates and all leap years.
