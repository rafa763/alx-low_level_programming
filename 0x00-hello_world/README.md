# Project 0x00: Hello, World

Welcome to **Project 0x00: Hello, World**, part of the ALX Low-Level Programming curriculum. This project serves as an introduction to C programming and covers various aspects of the language, including preprocessing, compiling, assembly code generation, and more.

## Project Overview 

This project focuses on the fundamentals of C programming and aims to help you become familiar with the following concepts:

- **Preprocessor:** Write a script that processes a C file using the preprocessor and saves the result to another file.
- **Compiler:** Create a script that compiles a C file without linking it. The output file should have the .o extension.
- **Assembler:** Develop a script to generate the assembly code for a given C file and save it with a .s extension.
- **Name:** Write a script that compiles a C file and generates an executable named `cisfun`.
- **Hello, puts:** Create a C program that prints a specific message using the `puts` function.
- **Hello, printf:** Develop a C program that prints a message with proper grammar using the `printf` function.
- **Size is not grandeur, and territory does not make a nation:** Build a C program that displays the sizes of various data types on the host system.
- **Intel:** Write a script to generate assembly code using Intel syntax from a given C file and save it with a .s extension.
- **UNIX is basically a simple operating system:** Create a C program that prints a quote to the standard error stream without using certain functions.
